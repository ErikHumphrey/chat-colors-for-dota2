##What is this?

Chat Colors for Dota 2 facilitates adding color to your chat in Dota 2. Normally you would have to use a hex editor to find the proper colors to paste into chat, but this program makes it easier. Coded in C# and powered by .NET Framework 4.5, for Windows.

Download and open the .exe and follow the instructions in the Help menu. Pin it to your taskbar and open it when you want to share dank memes during a match of Dota 2. Please report any bugs you find to me on Reddit or the Issues section on GitHub.
